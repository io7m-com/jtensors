## jtensors

The `jtensors` package package implements a set of vector and matrix types,
intended for use in computer graphics software.

## Features

* 2D, 3D, and 4D immutable vector types in `float` and `double` versions.
* 2D, 3D, and 4D immutable vector types in `int` and `long` versions.
* 4D immutable quaternion types in `float` and `double` versions.
* 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 mutable matrix types in `float` and `double` versions.
* Phantom-typed variants of all types for statically distinguishing between
  semantically different but otherwise type-compatible vectors and matrices.
* Fully documented (Javadoc).
* Massive battery of tests for checking the behaviour of matrix/vector implementations.
* 100% automated unit test coverage.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/)
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)
* ISC license.
