[paragraph]
The [term [type package] com.io7m.jtensors] package provides quaternions
with single-precision [term [type type] "(float)"] elements, and double-precision
[term [type type] "(double)"] elements. The package unambiguously identifies
the quaternion types by using the following naming conventions for the types
"(given as a simple EBNF grammar)":

The available quaternion types include:
